This Test Texts is a Test.
The other Test files are just random data I had lying around in the project.
The Json Test is a lookup table. It tells the automatic file load mode how to open what files.
The Variant version is the same data but saved with Godots format. This has a few more features than json. 
Namely that you can save whole nodes. I'm not sure how well that works but you can do it.
The  binary file is just the first idk bytes of icon.png
